# Description 

MR imaging is known to be based in an ill-posed reconstruction model more likely to introduce artifacts than other clinical imaging techniques. This study aims to model spatiotemporal correlations in MR imaging using deep recurrent neural networks for use in automated artifact identification. In particular, this study focuses on leveraging PredNet, a deep predictive coding network for video prediction developed by the Cox Lab at Harvard. PredNet was trained using time- resolved MR image slices to predict the next frame in a sequence. Our results show that PredNet correlate spatiotemporal features across time-resolved MR images. Future work will focus on the implementation of a comparison algorithm to derive a map between individual images that may contain artifacts within a time-resolved data set.
